[Hermit](https://github.com/hermit-os/hermit-rs) is a [unikernel](http://unikernel.org) targeting a scalable and predictable runtime for high-performance and cloud computing.
Unikernel means, you bundle your application directly with the kernel library, so that it can run without any installed operating system.
This reduces overhead, therefore, interesting applications include virtual machines and high-performance computing.

# Background

**Hermit** is a rewrite of HermitCore in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) developed at [RWTH-Aachen](https://www.rwth-aachen.de).
HermitCore was a research unikernel written in C ([libhermit](https://github.com/hermit-os/libhermit)).

The ownership  model of Rust guarantees memory/thread-safety and enables us to eliminate many classes of bugs at compile-time.
Consequently, the use of Rust for kernel development promises fewer vulnerabilities in comparison to common programming languages.

The kernel and the integration into the Rust runtime are entirely written in Rust and do not use any C/C++ Code.
We extended the Rust toolchain so that the build process is similar to Rust's usual workflow.
Rust applications that use the Rust runtime and do not directly use OS services are able to run on Hermit without modifications.

## Requirements

* [`rustup`](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

## Building your own applications

Have a look at [the template](https://github.com/hermit-os/hermit-rs-template).

## Use Hermit for C/C++, Go, and Fortran applications

If you are interested to build C/C++, Go, and Fortran applications on top of a Rust-based library operating system, please take a look at [https://github.com/hermit-os/hermit-playground](https://github.com/hermit-os/hermit-playground).
